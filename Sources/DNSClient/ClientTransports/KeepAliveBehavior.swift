/// A keep-alive behavior for DNS connections.

/// The ``frequency`` defines the keep-alive time amount that SwiftDNS will request from servers.

/// DNS runs primarily on UDP, where sending keep-alive is not meaningful.

/// SwiftDNS will try to negotiate keeping connection alive through EDNS with the server with
/// the behavior defined here, but servers are free to not respect SwiftDNS's request.
/// For more information, see [RFC 7828, The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS0 Option, April 2016](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7828#section-3.2).
